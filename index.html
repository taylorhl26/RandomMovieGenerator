        <p>Have you ever been searching for a movie to watch, but can't find anything and decide to give up?</p>
        <p>I have been there also which led me to create this web app! The tool built for this web application provides you with a random movie title based on two simple questions. You provide the genre of movie and decade of the movie you are looking for and we will provide you with five random movie titles that fit that category!</p>
